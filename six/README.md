## 1. Introduction
---
This excersize was a simple ball and container that checked for overlap/contact.
## 2. How this fulfills / does not fulfill the specification
---
This follows the specification to the word.
All methods are present, and only those are, and fields are limited to those in the spec.
## 3. Explanation of current errors 
---
None so far. If direction is out of bounds [-180, 180], the constructor will throw and IllegalArgumentException.
## 4. Overview
---
Ball and container. Container moves ball, and if it detects an overlap in their domains, reverses the delta of the impact.
## 5. Challenges
---
None, just a lot of fluff.
## 6. Acknowledgements
---
None here.
