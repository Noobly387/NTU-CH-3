## 1. Introduction
---
Excersize two required nothing but to write a class that had a clear specification.
## 2. How this fulfills / does not fulfill the specification
---
This follows the specification to the word.
## 3. Explanation of current errors 
---
None so far.
## 4. Overview
---
A class built around polynomials, prints, adds and multiplies them. All operators are nonstatic.
## 5. Challenges
---
Took me a couple minutes to realize that ordering of the coefficients was a bit janky with printing and multiplying.
## 6. Acknowledgements
---
None here.
## 7. Problems
---
1. The degree of a polynomial does not need to be kept, strictly speaking in java, as you can just find the lowest non-zero coefficent. The same would apply to C/C++, however, in both cases performance would increase.
