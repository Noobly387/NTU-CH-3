A class whose object keeps track of the date.

---
This follows the specification to the word.

## 3. Explanation of current errors

None so far, although incorrect dates cause Exceptions

## 4. Overview

---
A class built around acting like a calendar, telling you the day of week, date, and incrementing and decrementing day, month, and year.

## 5. Challenges

---
Working with a limited number of fields is hard, especially when getting day of week requires what is basically an array, but instantiating one every call is heavy. Also, leap years are annoying. Very annoying.
