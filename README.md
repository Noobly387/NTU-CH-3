## 1. Introduction
---
These folders belong to the problems of NTU Chapter 3, named respectively. 
## 2. How this fulfills / does not fulfill the specification
---
The specifications are all followed to the extent that they describe. Anything else is made up by me.
## 3. Explanation of current errors 
---
None so far. Some methods and problems may throw exceptions, but that is part of their spec.
## 4. Overview
---
7 problems. All are done and javadocced, likely more so than necessary.
## 5. Challenges
---
None, just a lot of fluff. Polynomials were kind of a pain because foiling is like that.
## 6. Acknowledgements
---
None here.
